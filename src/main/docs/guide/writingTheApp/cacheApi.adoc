<1> To register a Singleton in Micronaut’s application context annotate your class with `javax.inject.Singleton`.
<2> Indicates a method is cacheable within the `headlines` cache name and for the `month` parameter.
<3> Emulate an expensive operation by sleeping for several seconds.
<4> The return value is cached with name `headlines` for the supplied `month`. The method invocation is never skipped even if the cache `headlines` for the supplied `month` already existed.
<5> Method invocation causes the invalidation of the cache `headlines` for the supplied `month`.
